            Employees can request time off directly from the app or the web.
            Your managers will be alerted and can approve or deny the request.
            If it's approved, we will make sure to not schedule them during
            that time period!

            Trading shifts allows for an easy way for employees to work when it
            is most convenient for them. Trading shifts by your employees 
            significantly lowers the number of cancellations. However, if they 
            still need to cancel we will let all the eligible employees know 
            and try to fill it as soon as possible.

          Other scheduling software claims to be free. But in order to be 
          useful you need to buy upgrades and packages for every feature you
          want to use. Scheduleless has no hidden features or upgrades. Pay
          one flat free and get access to everything. And we are the only 
          scheduling software that actually does your scheduling!
